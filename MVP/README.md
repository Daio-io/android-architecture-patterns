# MVP

Simple MVP pattern inspired by Google MVP TODO example, updated with a Navigation handler Activity.

## Package Structure

base - Contains the interfaces and class for views, presenters and navigation handler. This class's in this package should be implemented and extended by all views, presenters and navigation handlers.

screens - Contains packages related to each screen within your application. For example the home package contains the activity, view, presenter and any specific interface contracts required for interaction related to the Home screen.

services - Contains any services that will be consumed throughout your application. This is just an example package and not really related to the MVP pattern as such. It has been created purely to give an idea how you might consume a service within a presenter.
